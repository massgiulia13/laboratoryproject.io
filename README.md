# Project
Digital reconstruction of a typical Sardinian engagement ring.
Visit the website and see the documentation to explore the project. 
Important note: to load correctly the Universal Viewer IIIF Manifest, you have to connect to the localhost:3000 server (http://127.0.0.1:3000/). 
This can be done through chrome web app Web Server for Chrome or the app Servez (https://greggman.github.io/servez/). 
Be sure to select the right folder (in this case, the unzipped o cloned one containing this project) when connecting to the server. The manifest.json file should be there.
The manifest can also be downloaded directly from the website.
